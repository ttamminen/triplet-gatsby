                        If you received an email sent by us, it is because our
                        records indicate that you have expressly shared this
                        address for the purpose of receiving information from us

                        Each email that we send contains unsubscribe link that
                        will allow you stop receiving email from us. If you do

                        the unsubscribe link provided in the email. You will be

                        We use the latest and generally approved security
                        measures to protect against the loss, misuse and

                        Our email and data storage services may use
                        infrastructure that is based outside of the EU (namely,
                        the United States), and we, or our subcontractors, may
                        utilise cloud technology to store or process personal
                        information, which may result in storage of data outside
                        of the EU. By explicitly requesting information from us
                        (“opt-in”) you give us permission to store your

                    <p>
                        When you receive an email sent by us, the email may
                        include a so called web beacon to measure marketing
                        effectiveness. When you click on a link provided in the
                        email, we may record that response so that we can better
